THE IMAGE WILL NOT RENDER IN YOUR PC SINCE YOU HAVE TO FEED A BACKGROUND IMAGE IN .PY CODE, READ CODE COMMENTS TO KNOW MORE
to modify it as per your needs change all the app locations and names as per the apps you want i.e. change the location of apps in the provided list in the code. DO NOT REMOVE THE r IN (r'location of app')

May you have fun with this, :D

(to run the app run the batch file)
